# Quantum Gravitational Wave Detector

*Advanced relativistic quantum algorithms in a package so efficient your phone could probably run it*

## What is this?

A quantum simulation framework that lets you detect gravitational waves by modeling how they affect entangled quantum states. This project demonstrates how quantum entanglement across relativistic reference frames can be used to create an entirely new class of gravitational wave detectors.

## Key Features

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Processes gravitational wave data through quantum circuits in milliseconds, with minimal resource usage (seriously, it barely touches the GPU)
- **Compositional Architecture**: Revolutionary pipeline approach that chains multiple quantum topologies for up to 2× improvement in detection sensitivity
- **Topology Experiments**: Test various qubit entanglement patterns (star, linear, full) and discover which configurations best capture gravitational wave signals
- **Interactive CLI**: Experiment with different detector designs through an intuitive menu system

## The "Conventional Approach" vs. Our Quantum Shenanigans

| LIGO | This Quantum Detector |
|------|----------------------|
| 4 km long laser interferometers | Runs on your desktop |
| Costs over $1 billion | GPU barely notices it's running |
| Mechanical isolation systems | Pure quantum mathematics |
| Took decades to develop | Hacked together in a few days |

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum_gw_detector.git
cd quantum_gw_detector

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv qgw_env
source qgw_env/bin/activate  # Or activate.bat on Windows

# Install package
pip install -e .

# Optional: Install PyZX for circuit optimization
pip install pyzx
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run interactive menu
qgw-menu

# Or run a specific pipeline configuration
python -m qgw_detector.run_detector --mode single --event GW150914 --qubits 4 --entanglement linear
```

## The Magic: Pipeline Architecture

We discovered that chaining quantum detectors in specific configurations dramatically improves gravitational wave detection sensitivity. Top performers include:

```
4-linear → 4-full → 4-linear  (SNR: 5.61, 1.85× improvement)
4-star → 4-full → 4-linear    (SNR: 5.61, 1.85× improvement)
```

These configurations follow a quantum encoder→transformer→decoder pattern that might represent a fundamental principle in quantum information processing.

## How It Works

1. **Quantum Encoding**: Convert gravitational wave strain into phase shifts on entangled qubits
2. **Topology Specialization**: Different entanglement patterns (star, linear, full) excel at different aspects of signal processing
3. **Pipeline Processing**: Feed the output of one quantum detector into another for enhanced sensitivity
4. **Quantum Fisher Information**: Measure how much gravitational information is encoded in the quantum states

## Coming Soon™

- Web dashboard with real-time visualization
- Noise resilience testing
- Experiments with actual quantum hardware
- Integration with more gravitational wave datasets

## Seriously Though...

This project demonstrates that quantum computing approaches may someday offer alternatives to massive physical detectors like LIGO. The ability to detect spacetime distortions using relatively small quantum systems could revolutionize gravitational wave astronomy.

Plus, it's pretty cool that we can simulate a quantum system capable of detecting ripples in spacetime while using less resources than Chrome needs to display a cat GIF.
