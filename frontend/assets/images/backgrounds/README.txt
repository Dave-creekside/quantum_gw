BACKGROUND IMAGES GUIDE
=====================

This folder contains background images for the Quantum Gravitational Wave Detector web interface.

Files to place in this folder:
- desktop.jpg: Landscape-oriented background for desktop/tablet devices (recommended: 1920×1080px)
- mobile.jpg: Portrait-oriented background for mobile devices (recommended: 750×1334px)

Image recommendations:
1. Keep file sizes under 300KB if possible (500KB maximum)
2. Use JPEG format for best compression/quality balance
3. Choose images with space for overlay content
4. Darker or less busy images will provide better text contrast
5. If you need transparent areas, use PNG format instead

The CSS is already configured to display the appropriate image based on screen size.
If you replace these images, make sure to keep the same filenames.
